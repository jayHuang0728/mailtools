A simple set of tools for parsing a UNIX-style mbox file and for
uploading the messages from an mbox file to a remote IMAP server.
This has been used and tested against Google Gmail and is good for
migrating old archived mail to Gmail or other IMAP servers that
accept appending messages to your mailboxes.

You can test if mbox.rb will parse your mailbox correctly before
attempting an upload by running:

./mbox.rb yourmailfilehere

A command line like this should work for uploading to Gmail:

./mbox2imap.rb -f yourmailfilehere -h imap.gmail.com:993 -p yourpass -u youruname -m MyOldMail -s -r
